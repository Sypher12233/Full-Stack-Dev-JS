# HTML #

* HTML, CSS, JavaScript and SQL are the languages that form the core of the World Wide Web today!

* HTML stand for *H*yper *T*ext *M*arkup *L*anguage.

* The *ML* in HTML stands for *Markup Language*.

* Markup refers to a way of annotating text that is distinguishable from the text itself. The same way that a teacher might “markup” a student essay by underlining topic sentences and circling spelling errors, HTML annotates the content within a web page.

* The first step to building a website is learning HTML.

* HTML is a practical place to start learning to code.

* You can build basic websites after learning a little html, with text, images and videos.

* You can always open up your work-in-progress website with your browser and see what you are building.

## HTML Structure ##

* The relationship between elements and their ancestor and descendent elements is known as *hierarchy*.

* Understanding HTML hierarchy is important because child elements can inherit styling and behavior from their parent element.

## HTML tags ##

* An html tag is - the element name, surrounded by an opening `<` and closing `>` angle bracket.

* HTML separates content and annotation by using HTML tags.

## HTML Elements ##

* Simply an element is - a unit of content in an HTML document formed by HTML tags and the text or media it contains.

* HTML tags are the "markup" for HTML.

* A tag and the content between these tags is called an html element.

* HTML paragraph element is made up of  an `<p>` opening tag, the content and  a `</p>` closing tag and inside these tags is where the content .

* When an element is contained inside another element, it is considered the *child* of that element.

* The *child* element is said to be *nested* inside the parent element.

## HTML Body Element ##

* Only the content inside the opening and closing body tags can displayed to the screen.

* Many different type of content like text, images and buttons can be added to the body.

## HTML Link Element ##

* An html link element can be used to apply the *CSS* files to the current website.

* Example: `<a href=/resume/style.css>`.

* An HTML link tag is often used to create a connection between an HTML file and the CSS file and tells the browser to apply the CSS styles to the HTML.

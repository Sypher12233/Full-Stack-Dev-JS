# Overview #

Building websites requires technical knowledge of multiple languages and frameworks. You may wonder, “How is it possible for developers to know everything there is to know about every language?” The answer is, thankfully, they don’t. One of the most essential skills of being a developer is knowing how to investigate solutions to problems you have not yet learned how to solve.

In this lesson, you will learn how to look up new ways to use previously-learned CSS properties and discover entirely new CSS properties.

On the right side of the screen is the portfolio site that you will develop into [the final product](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/capstone-1-documentation/mocks.jpg?_gl=1*119acy*_ga*NDY3MTkyNDQyMi4xNjU2MTU0NDI3*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*MTY1Njc2MDk5OS4yMy4xLjE2NTY3NjEwMTguNDE.). We suggest you keep this mock open in a separate tab for reference throughout the lesson.

## Documentation ##

Every well-developed language or framework has a place where you can look up all of its features. This library of information is called a language’s documentation.

You can find the documentation for CSS at [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) . In addition to CSS, The Mozilla Developer Network (referred to as MDN) contains the complete documentation for HTML, JavaScript, and many other essential tools of web development.

To see the documentation for a specific CSS property, navigate to the MDN website and search for that property in the search bar at the top of the page. Then, click on the link for that property. For example, search for the `font-weight` property. The list of results might appear intimidating, but you should quickly see a link starting with the description “The font-weight css property…”. This is the link we want.

Once you land on a property’s documentation page you can read all of the information about it. For example, `font-weight` starts with a description of the property. The “Values” section lists all of the possible values for `font-weight`. There are some values you already know, such as `normal` and `bold`, but there are also new values, such as `lighter` and `bolder`.

## Google ##

Documentation is an essential tool to learn about properties. However, what if you don’t even know what property you need?

In situations like this, it might come as no surprise that using Google is a great way to read other developers’ solutions to problems. Googling the problem you’re trying to solve and the language you’re using will yield many useful answers.

For example, if you want to know how to change the size of text, you could google “how to change text size using CSS.” After doing this, you will receive multiple links to information about the font-size property.

## Stack Overflow ##

While using Google in the previous exercise, you may have noticed a lot of links to a site called Stack Overflow.

Stack Overflow is a useful resource where developers ask and answer questions. You should use it to find answers to your questions, and learn from experienced developers.

Reading all of the top-voted answers to a Stack Overflow question can give you multiple solutions to try as well as an understanding of why one solution might be better than another. Additionally, if you can’t find a question, you can even ask it yourself and receive answers.

To search for a question on Stack Overflow, type your question and programming language into the search bar and find the question threads that seem relevant.

## Review ##

Awesome! With just a few simple searches and some research you completed the header for your portfolio site. Reading documentation and searching Google and Stack Overflow make it easy to solve development problems, even if you haven’t previously encountered the right tool for the job.

In summary:

Documentation is an easy way to view all of the information about a language or framework. The Mozilla Development Network is the source of documentation for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Investigating a new language feature is as easy as typing the problem and the language into Google or Stack Overflow.
Now that you know how to find any feature and read its documentation, the sky’s the limit on what you can do. Feel free to browse MDN and Stack Overflow to find new features and try incorporating them into your header to make it look even better. Great job!

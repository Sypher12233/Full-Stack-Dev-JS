# JavaScript #

1. JS is used to make websites interactive.

1. Some website features that are commonly built with JS are:

* popup ads

* animated graphics (2D or 3D)

* interactive video or audio

* maps and other features access user's geographic location

* and much more!

3. One of the defining features of JavaScript is its ability to respond to browser events. These events happen in real time and can be triggered by a wide variety of user interactions, including:

* the user clicking on a button

* the user pressing enter on the keyboard

* a video file finishing loading

* the user re-sizing their window

* the user hovering over text on the webpage

4. Functions in JS are reusable blocks of code, designed to perform a specific task.

5. Functions allow us to write a chunk of code once that can be reused over and over again.

6. Events allow JS to respond to user behaviors like, the user hovering their mouse over an html element or resizing their window.

7. When an event is fired the function is executed.
